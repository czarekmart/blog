    Watchers
    <ul>
        <li>Angular objects that are constantly watching for changes in the app angular-conforming variables.</li>
        <li>Watchers watch changes to keep angular binding in sync</li>
    </ul>

    Digest Loop
    <ul>
        <li>The digest cycle loops that allows watchers to do their watch.</li>
    </ul>

    Example
    <div class="code">
        <pre><code>

$scope.myVariable;
$scope.$watch('myVariable', function(newValue, oldValue) {
    // Do something with the chagne
} );

//Example:

// This change is not watched, because it's inside timer, which
// is not watched by the watchers

setTimeout(function() {
    // This change is not watched!
    $scope.myVariable = 1;
}, 3000);

// To fix it, the following must be done:

setTimeout(function() {
    $scope.$apply(function() {
        $scope.myVariable = 1;	// this is watched!
    });
}, 3000);

// Another solution to this is using $timeout
//-- Remember to inject it!
$timeout(function() {
    $scope.myVariable = 1;
}, 3000);
